## ðŸ“˜ Task Explanation:

The purpose of this task is to perform **network reconnaissance** by scanning the local network to discover **active devices** and identify any **open ports** that could expose services to potential attackers.

To do this, I used the **Nmap tool**, which is widely used in cybersecurity for mapping networks, identifying hosts, and scanning ports.

### Steps I Followed:
1. **Identified my local network IP range** using `ip a` (Linux) to find the subnet, e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`.
2. **Ran a TCP SYN scan** using:
   ```bash
   sudo nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24
3. Noted the results: I found 3 active devices. One of them (the router) had port 80 and 443 open (used for HTTP and HTTPS). Other devices had all ports closed.
4. Analyzed security exposure: Open ports mean the device is listening for incoming connections. If unused, these can become entry points for attackers.
5. Saved scan result to nmap_output_task1.txt and created a README.md to document everything.


Why This Task Matters:
It helps me understand how attackers or penetration testers discover systems and services in a network.
